  title: "One Rule to Rule Them All?",
  subtitle: "An Analysis of the Cross-Country Asymmetric Effects of the ECB’s Monetary Policy (1999Q2–2024Q1).",
  executiveSummary: "This project investigates whether a single Taylor-type monetary policy rule can adequately describe the ECB’s interest rate setting and whether such a rule can be optimal for heterogeneous euro area economies. Using two-step GMM estimation on quarterly data from 1999 to 2024, the analysis estimates backward-looking Taylor rules. The findings highlight significant Taylor principle violations and instability across sub-periods. By simulating synthetic national interest rates, the study reveals persistent cross-country asymmetries, especially between core and periphery economies, highlighting the limits of a 'one-size-fits-all' policy.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "Does a single Taylor-type rule adequately describe ECB interest rate setting over the long run?",
    "How stable is the ECB's policy reaction function across pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods?",

      question: "Why use a backward-looking Taylor rule when the ECB is forward-looking?",
      answer: "While the ECB emphasizes forward-looking projections, backward-looking rules allow us to evaluate the actual realized response to observable data. It serves as a more transparent benchmark for cross-country asymmetric effects, as real-time national forecasts are often inconsistent or unavailable for the full sample period.",

    {
      question: "How do you handle the endogeneity of inflation and output gaps?",
      answer: "We employ a two-step GMM estimator using lagged values of macroeconomic variables as instruments. This ensures that our coefficients are not biased by the simultaneous feedback between interest rates and the economic state, which is a common pitfall in OLS estimations of policy rules.",

      question: "Does the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB) invalidate your linear GMM results?",
      answer: "The ZLB introduces a nonlinearity that linear models cannot fully capture. However, sub-period analysis (2009-2014 vs. 2015-2022) shows that while the coefficient magnitudes shift, the direction of the asymmetric gaps between core and periphery remains statistically significant and institutionally relevant.",
