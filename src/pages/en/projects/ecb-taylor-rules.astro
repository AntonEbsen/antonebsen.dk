  title: "One Rule to Rule Them All?",
  subtitle: "An Analysis of the Cross-Country Asymmetric Effects of the ECB’s Monetary Policy (1999Q2–2024Q1).",
  executiveSummary: "This project investigates whether a single Taylor-type monetary policy rule can adequately describe the ECB’s interest rate setting and whether such a rule can be optimal for heterogeneous euro area economies. Using two-step GMM estimation on quarterly data from 1999 to 2024, the analysis estimates backward-looking Taylor rules. The findings highlight significant Taylor principle violations and instability across sub-periods. By simulating synthetic national interest rates, the study reveals persistent cross-country asymmetries, especially between core and periphery economies, highlighting the limits of a 'one-size-fits-all' policy.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "Does a single Taylor-type rule adequately describe ECB interest rate setting over the long run?",
    "How stable is the ECB's policy reaction function across pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods?",
    "What are the magnitudes of the interest rate gaps when aggregate policy is applied to heterogeneous national economic conditions?"
