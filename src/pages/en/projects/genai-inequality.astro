  title: "Does GenAI Help Those Who Need It Most?",
  subtitle: "Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects of Generative AI on Student Performance in Danish High Schools.",
  executiveSummary: "As Generative AI becomes ubiquitous in education, a critical question emerges: Does it level the playing field or exacerbate existing inequalities? This project, submitted as a research proposal in January 2026, proposes an investigation into the heterogeneous effects of GenAI usage across socioeconomic backgrounds. By linking detailed survey data with administrative grade records from Danish upper-secondary schools, we aim to uncover whether AI acts as an 'equalizer' or if it deepens existing divides.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "What are the heterogeneous effects of GenAI usage on the academic outcomes of students?",
    "Does the introduction of GenAI in education reduce or deepen existing socioeconomic inequalities?",
    "Do students from different socioeconomic backgrounds use GenAI at different rates, for different subjects, and for different purposes?"
  ],
  methodology: {
    model: "Causal Forest (Machine Learning Inference)",
    strategy: "Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) to capture non-linear heterogeneity.",
    data: "Primary Survey Data + Administrative Grade Records (Pre/Post GenAI) for ~800 students.",
    estimation: "Difference-in-Differences setup within a Causal Forest framework to control for high-dimensional covariates."
  },
  keyFindings: [
    "Research Proposal: This project is a research design without empirical results yet.",
    "Hypothesis: We expect the impact of AI to vary significantly based on student background and usage patterns.",
    "Focus: Differentiating between 'high-quality' (tutor-like) and 'low-quality' (shortcut) usage is key.",
    "Ethics: The project addresses fairness and the long-term consequences of AI in the educational system."
  ],
  secondaryAnalysis: {
    title: "The Causal Forest Approach",
    description: "Unlike traditional regression models, a Causal Forest allows us to estimate the treatment effect for *each individual student* based on their characteristics.",
    items: [
      "Personalized Estimates: The algorithm automatically identifies which variables (e.g., parental education) drive differences in impact.",
      "Data-Driven Subgroups: We avoid pre-defining groups and let the data reveal the heterogeneity.",
      "Robustness: Using 'Honest Trees' ensures valid inference without overfitting."
    ]
  },
  policyRelevance: [
    "Evidence-based regulation: Should schools ban, restrict, or embrace GenAI?",
    "Equity in Education: Identifying groups that need targeted support for 'AI Literacy'.",
    "Future Skills: Understanding how early adoption affects human capital accumulation."
  ],
  limitations: [
    "Selection: GenAI usage is voluntary, not randomly assigned. We rely on 'selection on observables'.",
    "Self-Reporting: Risk of underreporting cheating in surveys.",
    "Short-term: We primarily measure effects on grades, not long-term learning."
