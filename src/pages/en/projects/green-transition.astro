  title: "The Single Market's Role in the Green Transition",
  subtitle: "An analysis of EU economic policy and regulation as a driver for sustainable transition.",
  executiveSummary: "This project analyzes the EU's role in the green transition, focusing on how economic policy, regulation, and institutional cooperation can be used to promote a sustainable transition of European economies. The project examines how climate and environmental policy in the EU is not merely a question of norms and goals, but also a matter of economic incentives, market design, and coordination among member states.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "How does the EU function as a framework setter for the green transition?",
    "Which economic instruments are most effective in promoting sustainability?",
    "What trade-offs exist between ambitious climate policy and competitiveness?",
    "Why is European coordination crucial to avoid leakage and competitive distortion?"
  ],
  methodology: {
    model: "Political Economy Analysis",
    strategy: "Combination of economic theory, EU political analysis, and concrete policy examples.",
    data: "EU directives, market data for CO2 allowances, green technology investment figures.",
    estimation: "Assessment of regulation's effect on market behavior and investments."
  },
  keyFindings: [
    "EU as Framework Setter: Common regulation and market-based instruments reduce the risk of national fragmentation.",
    "Economic Instruments: CO₂ pricing and market regulation are more effective than symbolic policy.",
    "Trade-offs: Ambitious climate policy creates short-term costs but long-term gains in innovation and autonomy.",
    "Coordination: Without common solutions, there is a risk of uneven playing fields and capital flight."
  ],
