  title: "The Single Market's Impact on the Irish Tiger Economy",
  subtitle: "Analyzing the interplay between market integration, FDI, and national policy in Ireland.",
  executiveSummary: "This project analyzes how the EU’s Single Market contributed to the development of the so-called Irish Tiger Economy. The project investigates how Ireland’s growth model in the 1990s and 2000s was driven by institutional integration into the EU and strategic attraction of foreign direct investment—but also how this model created structural vulnerabilities that became fatal during the financial crisis.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "How did the EU Single Market function as a growth engine for the Irish economy?",
    "What role did Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) play in productivity and employment?",
    "Why was the Irish growth model so vulnerable to the global financial crisis?",
    "Is EU integration value-neutral for national political choices?"
  ],
  methodology: {
    model: "Interdisciplinary Analysis (Economics & History)",
    strategy: "Case study of a small open economy in a globalized world.",
    data: "Macroeconomic indicators (GDP, FDI, Unemployment) and historical sources.",
    estimation: "Qualitative assessment of causal links between EU policy and national growth."
  },
  keyFindings: [
    "Growth Engine: The Single Market reduced trade barriers and made Ireland an attractive 'hub' for US companies (Tech/Pharma).",
    "FDI Dependency: High capital inflows boosted productivity but created an economy dependent on external decision-makers.",
    "Fragility: The growth model was concentrated and reliant on tax incentives, exacerbating the crisis when capital flows reversed.",
    "Political Space: EU membership creates opportunities but also limits the policy space of nation-states during crises."
  ],
  secondaryAnalysis: {
    title: "Forward-Looking Perspective",
    description: "The project raises the question of how small open economies can balance growth and stability.",
    items: [
      "Strategic Autonomy: Can high growth be maintained without building unsustainable financial risks?",
      "Robustness: The need to diversify the economy away from one-sided dependence on specific sectors.",
      "Relevance: An early case study in the mechanisms (austerity, debt, competition) that later defined the Euro crisis."
