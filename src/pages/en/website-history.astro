        <h2 class="section-title">TL;DR</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The website started as a place to gather CV + projects in one place (and avoid the "where is that now?"-trap).</li>
          <li>It quickly evolved into a small system: Portfolio, Resources/Downloads, and a Blog for notes.</li>
          <li>I built statistics pages (course stats and training stats) to show progression rather than just claims.</li>
          <li>The goal is to make things easy to find: fewer clicks, clear navigation, and documentable content.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- WHY -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">Why build a personal website at all?</h2>
        <p>
          I've always had a fairly classic challenge: many projects, many files, many versions.
          And when you work with study projects, code, teaching materials, and a CV, "link chaos"
          quickly becomes a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea was actually simple and a bit old-school: one place that I own, where the most important things live.
          Not just a profile — but a structured base where I can update things continuously without having to
          reinvent everything every time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- BUILD -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="section-title">How it was built (without making it unnecessarily fancy)</h2>
        <p>
          I chose a "keep it clean" approach: pure HTML/CSS, a clear navbar, and reusable cards for content.
          It sounds simple — but that's exactly what makes it maintainable.
        </p>

        <div class="grid" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <div class="card post p-6">
            <div class="post-top flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
              <h3 class="post-title font-bold text-lg">Principle 1: Structure over aesthetics</h3>
              <span class="tag text-xs bg-accent/20 px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-accent">Design</span>
            </div>
            <p class="muted text-sm" style="margin:0;">
              If the navigation is logical, the site can look 20% less "fancy" and still be 10x more useful.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card post p-6">
            <div class="post-top flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
              <h3 class="post-title font-bold text-lg">Principle 2: It must be extensible</h3>
              <span class="tag text-xs bg-accent/20 px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-accent">System</span>
            </div>
            <p class="muted text-sm" style="margin:0;">
              New pages (courses, certs, notes, media) must be plug-and-play: same layout, same footer, same style.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card post p-6">
            <div class="post-top flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
              <h3 class="post-title font-bold text-lg">Principle 3: Documentation beats vibes</h3>
              <span class="tag text-xs bg-accent/20 px-2 py-0.5 rounded text-accent">Proof</span>
            </div>
            <p class="muted text-sm" style="margin:0;">
              That's why the statistics pages became a thing. It's hard to argue against data when it's presented clearly.

        <div class="card p-6" style="background:rgba(255,215,0,0.02); border:1px solid rgba(255,215,0,0.1);">
          <ul class="space-y-2" style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
            <li><strong>Version 1:</strong> CV + contact. (The minimum requirement.)</li>
            <li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Portfolio with projects + cases. (The extra mile.)</li>
            <li><strong>Version 3:</strong> Resources/Downloads. (Tools I use myself and can share.)</li>
            <li><strong>Version 4:</strong> Blog with three tracks: professional, training, travel.</li>
            <li><strong>Version 5:</strong> Statistics pages: course evaluations and training data. (Progression, not just words.)</li>
            <li><strong>Now:</strong> Multiple sub-pages under CV (skills, experience, courses, certs) + "Press/Media".</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="muted mt-4" style="margin-top:12px;">
          And yes — some of it sounds like "overkill". But when you update often, structure suddenly becomes a superpower.

        <h2 class="section-title">Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          The most obvious next upgrade is to make the blog more robust: either with more individual posts 
          (like this page) or a simple tag system. Additionally, it makes sense to expand the CV section 
          further into dedicated sub-pages to keep the main CV from becoming a wall of text.
