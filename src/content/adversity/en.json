                "My upbringing was marked by illness on multiple fronts. I suffered from severe epilepsy and was hospitalized up to 11 times a month. A brain scan confirmed that I had brain damage in the left hemisphere – the aftereffects of a stroke I had survived as a child.",
                "But the story also hides another truth. The fact that I was perceived as \"mentally behind\" was largely due to a systemic failure: the staff in my kindergarten often forgot to give me my epilepsy medication. This meant my parents had to give me a <strong>double dose</strong> when I got home – a medication that is extremely sedating for the brain. My cognitive sluggishness was thus as much medically induced as it was biological.",
                "In kindergarten, I felt the isolation deeply. Because I had difficulty speaking, I took refuge in my own world. I would go up on a hill in the playground and seek comfort in God and Jesus. When the system failed to show me care, I found love in faith."
