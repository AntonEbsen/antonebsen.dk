  title: "Global Financial Cycle & spillovers",
  subtitle: "Analysis of U.S. monetary policy spillovers using a structural VAR framework (2001Q4-2023Q3).",
  executiveSummary: "This thesis analyzes the effects of monetary policy spillovers from the US on the global economy. Using a recursive VAR framework influenced by Rey (2013), the study examines the transmission of shocks via global risk (VIX) and the leverage of European banks. The findings confirm the continued existence of these spillovers but highlight a significant reduction in magnitude during the COVID-19 period, likely attributable to enhanced regulatory environments.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "How does a shock to the US effective federal funds rate impact global risk as measured by the VIX?",
    "How does global risk impact the global financial cycle (leverage, credit growth, and cross-border flows)?",
    "How do current spillover dynamics differ from the results found in Rey (2013) for the 1990-2012 period?"
  ],
  methodology: {
    model: "Structural VAR (Vector Autoregression) with recursive identification (Cholesky decomposition).",
    strategy: "Seven-variable system including US policy rates, global risk indices, and credit flow indicators.",
    data: "Quarterly frequency covering the period from 2001Q4 to 2023Q3.",
    estimation: "Estimation of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) across different subsamples to analyze structural shifts."
  },
  keyFindings: [
    "Continued existence of US monetary spillovers, though with lower magnitude in the COVID-19 period.",
    "US monetary loosening found to decrease global risk, subsequently increasing European bank leverage.",
    "A structural break in the risk-taking channel during COVID-19: lower risk resulted in lower global domestic credit, suggesting successful macroprudential policy intervention.",
    "Enhanced regulations since the Global Financial Crisis have mitigated excessive risk-taking propagation."
  ],
  policyRelevance: [
    "Highlights the persistent role of the Federal Reserve as a 'global central bank' influencing international financial stability.",
    "Suggests that macroprudential policies implemented since 2016 (Saft, 2016) have been effective in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic from escalating into a global financial crisis.",
    "Emphasizes the need for continued monitoring of bank leverage by international regulators despite general deleveraging trends."

      question: "Why use a Cholesky decomposition instead of Sign Restrictions?",
      answer: "While sign restrictions allow for more agnostic identification, the Cholesky decomposition provides a clear, recursive benchmark that is directly comparable to the seminal Hélène Rey (2013) framework. This choice was deliberate to ensure that deviations in results can be attributed to data/sample differences rather than identification strategy alone.",

    {
      question: "Is the VIX still a valid proxy for the GFC post-2020?",
      answer: "Post-2020, we see a 'decoupling' of VIX from global liquidity due to changed market microstructure. However, for a 20-year sample analysis, it remains the most robust and institutionally accepted metric for modeling global risk appetite—though I acknowledge that incorporating an EBP (Excess Bond Premium) would be the logical next step.",

    {
      question: "How do you account for the 2008-2014 Zero Lower Bound (ZLB)?",
      answer: "The EFFR loses its signaling power at the ZLB. I addressed this by cross-validating results with Shadow Short Rates (Wu-Xia), which showed that the sign of the transmission remains the same, even if the magnitude of the impulse responses slightly shifts during the ZLB era.",
