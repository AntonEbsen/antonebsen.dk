  title: "Competitiveness and Welfare Model",
  subtitle: "An analysis of the relationship between national competitiveness and the welfare state.",
  executiveSummary: "This project analyzes the relationship between national competitiveness and the design of the welfare state, focusing on the classic tension between economic efficiency, cost levels, and social protection. The project investigates whether a comprehensive welfare model necessarily weakens a country's competitiveness, or whether specific institutional designs can conversely act as a productivity and stability-promoting element in a globalized economy.",
  researchQuestions: [
    "How do different welfare models affect countries' competitiveness?",
    "Can high taxes and social protection be reconciled with economic growth?",
    "What trade-offs exist between equality and efficiency in an open economy?",
    "How can institutional quality strengthen competitiveness?"
  ],
  methodology: {
    model: "Comparative Analysis (Economics & Society)",
    strategy: "Comparison of welfare regimes and their macroeconomic performance.",
    data: "Macroeconomic indicators (Productivity, Unit Labor Costs, Gini Coefficient).",
    estimation: "Qualitative assessment of institutional effects on the labor market."
  },
  keyFindings: [
    "More than Wages: Competitiveness depends not only on labor costs but also on productivity, human capital, and institutional stability.",
    "Welfare as Investment: A well-developed welfare state can support labor supply, reduce uncertainty, and promote education.",
    "Trade-offs: There is a balancing act between short-term cost competitiveness and long-term productivity development.",
    "No Universal Model: Effects depend on country-specific institutions and economic structure."

    title: "Forward-Looking Perspective",

      "Social Cohesion: Economic resilience requires legitimacy and social stability.",
      "Relevance Today: The debate is central to understanding the future of the welfare state in a globalized world."
