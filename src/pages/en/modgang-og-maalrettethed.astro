        My journey has not been a straight line. It is shaped by the moments where others questioned my abilities, and where the will to prove them wrong became my greatest driving force.

      <h2>The Foundation of Doubt</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My upbringing was marked by illness on multiple fronts. I suffered from severe epilepsy and was hospitalized up to 11 times a month. A brain scan confirmed that I had brain damage in the left hemisphere – the aftereffects of a stroke I had survived as a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the story also hides another truth. The fact that I was perceived as "mentally behind" was largely due to a systemic failure: the staff in my kindergarten often forgot to give me my epilepsy medication. This meant my parents had to give me a <strong>double dose</strong> when I got home – a medication that is extremely sedating for the brain. My cognitive sluggishness was thus as much medically induced as it was biological.
        </p>
        <p>
          In kindergarten, I felt the isolation deeply. Because I had difficulty speaking, I took refuge in my own world. I would go up on a hill in the playground and seek comfort in God and Jesus. When the system failed to show me care, I found love in faith.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-box">
          While the staff mockingly called me <strong>"Moses"</strong>, the Christian message hit me with euphoria: Jesus loves everyone. That childhood faith remains my foundation to this day.
        </div>
        <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.2);">
          "None of the other children want to play with Anton."
          <br>
          <small style="font-style: normal; opacity: 0.6; font-size: 0.9rem;">— Said by my special educator to my parents</small>
        </div>
        <p>
          Yet, amidst the system's cold judgment, there is a small light I carry with me: a memory of one of the girls in kindergarten who said to the others, <strong>"You shouldn't bully Anton."</strong> It was a small gesture, but it showed that even in the toughest environments, glimmers of human kindness exist.

      <h2>The Judgment – and New Hope</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Starting school didn't get easier. Teachers assessed that my future lay in a special school for children with behavioral challenges. They had given up on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my parents refused to accept that verdict. When they told my new teacher at the private school what the system had said, the answer came promptly:
        </p>
        <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: #22c55e;">
          "Of course Anton can manage a normal school education."
        </div>
        <p>
          For the first time, I felt seen and heard. It was the starting signal to show the world – and the system – who I really was.

      <h2>A Night Bathed in Fear</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In third grade, I approached my last epileptic seizure. I had stopped my medication, but at the same time, a tragedy occurred: a staff member at my after-school club lost his life in the forest after an epileptic seizure because he hadn't taken his medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          That death struck me with a paralyzing fear for my own life. That same night, my worst seizure yet occurred. My father shook me as tears ran down his cheeks, shouting, <strong>"Anton, you mustn't die!"</strong> That moment marked the final chapter of my time as a patient.

      <h2>When the Body Almost Gave Up</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          During middle school, my asthma hit its absolute low point. I was born with severe asthma and have only <strong>72 percent lung capacity</strong>. I was hospitalized for several days while my body fought a battle it was dangerously close to losing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctor later said words to my parents that still give me chills: <strong>"If he had gone to sleep at home, he would have passed away quietly."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing you've been so close to the edge gives you a unique perspective. It has shaped my humanistic view: we are all of equal value, regardless of cognitive abilities, physics, or background.

      <h2>The Battle Against Invisible Letters</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Dyslexia became the next obstacle. My dictations were marked by frustration, but my mother set a limit: either I found a way, or she would no longer pay for my schooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed my own visual method and began to visualize the <strong>QWERTY keyboard</strong> in my mind when I had to spell. The strategy bore fruit, and I finished primary school with a <strong>top grade</strong> in spelling.

      <h2>The Spark Ignited: The "Hunter" Mentality</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My first top grade ever was in Religious Studies. That was where the spark was ignited. I realized I had the abilities to reach the top. I became a "hunter."
        </p>
        <p>
          This hunter mentality culminated in business high school (HHX), where I became the <strong>top scorer of the year</strong> with an average of <strong>11.9</strong>. But it came at a price: at 18, I developed a stomach ulcer from the enormous pressure I put on myself.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-box" style="border-left-color: #ef4444;">
          I balanced school, my driver's license, and a candidacy for the European Parliament all at once. I learned that no matter how strong your will is, the body has its limits.

      <h2>Motivation's New Character</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Today, in the <strong>cand.polit (economics) program</strong>, I no longer chase grades for their own sake. Grade-chasing culture is unhealthy, and in a study program with high difficulty, you learn to appreciate the learning process itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when motivation fails, I find my way back to the core: that old voice from the system that said I would never make it. It ignites a fire in me – both in my studies and at the gym.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-box">
          "I will damn well show you."
        </div>
        <p>
          This is the foundation of my values: you shouldn't talk down to others, regardless of the circumstances. Because I have been at the bottom of the system myself, I know that potential is often found beneath the surface of diagnoses and medication.
